			<li><strong>Suppose you have an html document at http://www.mysite.com/faculty/john/index.html. Code an anchor element that links to http://www/mysite.com/students/bob/lab1.html. Use a relative, not absolute, link. You will not get credit for this question if you use a absolute link.</strong><br />
						&lt;a href="/students/bob/lab1.html"&gt;Bob&lt;a&gt;
			</li>
			<li><strong>Why does the map element have to come before the image tag for an imagemap to work correctly?</strong><br />
						The reason is that the brower starts from the begining and needs to know when to stop. As the browser is starting from the begining and reading through it's going to read the map element then afterwards the image tag.

			<li><strong>What is the difference between logical and physical markup, and why is it a better practice to avoid physical markup?</strong><br />
						Logical markup is showing the structure while physical markup is more as formatting. It's better to stay away from physical markup since it's irrevelant. 
			</li>
			<li><strong>List three UNIX commands you used while deploying lab 2 on cs1 and describe what they do.</strong><br />
						The three UNIX commands I used was cd, put, and chmod a+r. I used cd to change public_html working directory. I uploaded a file from my computer to the server by using put. I wanted to change permission for anyone can be capable of reading that file with chmod a+r.
